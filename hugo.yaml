  # The "description" of your website. This is used in the meta data of your generated html.
  description: "Hugo + Bear = :heart:"
  
  # The path to your "favicon". This should be a square (at least 32px x 32px) png-file.
  # Hint: It's good practise to also put a "favicon.ico"-file into your "static"-folder.
  # favicon = "images/favicon.png"

  # These "images" are used for the structured data templates. This will show up, when
  # services like Twitter or Slack want to generate a preview of a link to your site.
  # See https://gohugo.io/templates/internal#twitter-cards and
  # https://gohugo.io/templates/internal#open-graph.
  # images = ["images/share.png"]

  # Another "title" :-). This one is used as the site_name on the Hugo's internal
  # opengraph structured data template.
  # See https://ogp.me/ and https://gohugo.io/templates/internal#open-graph.
  # title = "Hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear"

  # This theme will, by default, inject a made-with-line at the bottom of the page.
  # You can turn it off, but we would really appreciate if you don’t :-).
